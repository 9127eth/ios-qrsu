I want to remove the requirement for the user to input https:// as a rule for url validation.


for QR codes, 
we should prepend https:// to the URL if the user doesnnt input it.

for each of these though. We do need to make sure the domain is valid.
so we should implement a URLValidator that checks if the domain is valid.
If it is not valid, the user should be asked if they want to proceed.
